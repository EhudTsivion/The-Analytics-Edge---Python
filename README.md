# The-Analytics-Edge---Python
Assignments from the edX MIT course "The Analytics Edge" using python instead of R. This is an exercise in independant work with pandas and the python environemnt for data science. 

I've used scikit-learn and statsmodels interchangably. 
Since some procedures such as splitting into train and test sets are random and depend on the algorithm and system type the results are not 100% in agreement.
